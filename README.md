**Project Description**:
* A laser tag game interface including splash, player entry, and game action screens.

**File Breakdown**:
* splash.html - This file displays the splash screen logo to a web browser page.
* playerEntry.html - This file displays the player entry screen to a web browser page and handles player input.
* proton.py - Essentially the main class. This class initially displays the splash screen and allows the user to move between it and the player screen.
* textbox.py - The textbox/"player" class. This class is used for the collection and organization of player data (id, firstname, lastname, and codename) 
               that is entered on the player entry screen.
* connect.py - Establishes and tests the connection with the Heroku database. It also controls the screen transitions.
* player.py -
* main.py - This class imports the Flask web framework.
* button.py - The button class. This class allows for the creation of buttons that when pressed, perform an action assigned to them in proton.py.
* player.sql - This sql file creates a player table consisting of ID, firstname, lastname, and codename. There are also two test "players" inserted into the table.
* requirements.txt - Allows us to locally host Heroku using Flask.
* Assets file - Contains images as well as font specifications for the player and splash screens.
* Pycache file - Contains auto-generated cache files generated by Python files.

**Disclaimer**:
 * The presence of both html and Python files that do very similar tasks is due to the back and forth design decisions made throughout our development.
   Using Python is the preferred development path, however, the javascript/html implementation is our current backup.
